This is an experimental build system for media drivers.
All files on this tree are covered by GPLv2, as stated at COPYING file.

Usage:

cd linux
make tar DIR=<some dir with media -git tree>
make untar

After that, it will work like the old -hg build system.

Notes:

1) There's not much compat stuff here. So, it will likely not work with
   legacy kernels. It will probably be fine to use it with the latest stable
   kernel.

2) For now, this is just an experience. I don't intend to maintain any
   out-of-tree building system, due to my lack of time. If this interests
   someone, feel free to candidate to maintain it.

3) It shouldn't be hard to support legacy kernels. All that it is needed is
   to have patches adding backports that don't fit at compat.h, and let the
   building system to apply them, depending on the kernel version.
